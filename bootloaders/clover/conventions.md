## Requirements

Let's assume for example that **AddMCHC** Clover Hot-patch needs to be enabled

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image-31%20%281%29.png)

In this case to shortcut it we'll use the following syntax

```text
config.plist/{SECTION}/{SUB_SECTION}/{PARAMETER}={TRUE/FALSE}
```

So in this case AddMCHC ticked will be something like that:

```text
config.plist/ACPI/Fixes/AddMCHC=True
```
